# Fractals

This repository contains Python scripts for generating fractal images, focusing on the Mandelbrot and Julia sets and features a custom implementation of complex numbers.

## Usage

To generate a fractal image, run either scripts (`mandelbrot.py` or `julia.py`). Make sure to change parameters within the script for different fractal patterns and zoom levels.
